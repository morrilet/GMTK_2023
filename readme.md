# GMTK 2023
Howdy howdy!

This is a game made in 48 hours for GMTK Jam 2023. The code is garbage, the stress is high, and the vision is flawed. Get ready for a good time.

## Required Software

If you plan to contribute you'll need the correct Unity and FMOD installs. The rest of the software (Blender, Photoshop, etc) is up to you.

* Unity Version 2022.3.4f1 (LTS)
* FMOD Unity Integration 2.02.15 (Unity Verified)

## Contributing

Given the timeframe, we'll be working on `main` for the jam. You're welcome to open branches but be sure to keep them short-lived, as the `main` branch will be highly volatile. Before committing any changes be sure to:

* Update from main
* Test your changes

Additionally, be sure to limit commits to the necessary files only. This will typically be an asset file and a `.meta` file for each changed or added asset. Settings changes should also be committed. While we have a `.gitignore` in place, it's entirely possible that Git picks up some cruft we didn't expect, so it's everyones responsibility to keep the repository clean. Dirty repos slow development. Finally, if any unwanted files crop up repeatedly we can edit the `.gitignore`.
